`Alt+Q` is the hotkey

You can set minimum and maximum angle for random rotation, use the N panel to find those inputs.

**Random Rotate XYZ** is a different add-on, as the name suggests, allows you to rotate randomly in all 3 axis. 
#
It have 2 modes - Increment Random Rotation & Normal Random Rotation

Increment will let you rotate in random increments of the specified axis.

For the Normal Random Rotation, you can specify a minimum and maximum value for each axis.
#

Unlike it's predecessor, RandomRotateXYZ allows you to choose between `Global`, `Local` and `Custom` Orientation, for the rotation axis.

What is the `Custom` Orientation?

It allows you to choose a custom object to determine the initial orientation/rotation of all the selected objects.
